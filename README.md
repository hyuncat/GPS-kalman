# GPS-kalman
Code to implement Kalman filtering for GPS time-series data for Caspar

### Cool things
Inside `/flask-vis` if you run
```shell
python app.py
```

You can visualize the data (either full or demo) in a simple flask app to explore any given person's movement on all available dates they had walked.
