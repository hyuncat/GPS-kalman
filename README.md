# GPS-kalman
Scripts and web app to implement and visualize Kalman filtering for GPS time-series data.

## Installation notes

Install package dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Notebook scripts

Current jupyter notebook scripts are found in `/notebooks` and include code for the following:

1. Kalman filtering GPS data
2. Map visualizations
3. Time segmentation
4. Road snapping

All code can be tested with data from `/notebooks/data`, though if you want to run it with all the training data you should download a file `all_plt_data` from the project Google Drive.

### Explore the data in the flask app

You can visualize the data (either full or demo) in a simple flask app to explore any given person's movement on all available dates they had walked. You can test this locally by running:

```shell
cd flask-app
python app.py
```

The app looks something like this:
